**INTRODUCTION**

A windscreen wiper or windshield wiper is a device used to remove rain, snow, ice and debris from a windscreen or windshield. Almost all motor vehicles, including cars, trucks, train locomotives, watercraft with a cabin and some aircraft, are equipped with such wipers, which are usually a legal requirement.
A wiper generally consists of a metal arm, pivoting at one end and with a long rubber blade attached to the other. The arm is powered by a motor, often an electric motor, although pneumatic power is also used in some vehicles. The blade is swung back and forth over the glass, pushing water or other precipitation from its surface.  The speed is normally adjustable, with several continuous speeds and often one or more "intermittent" settings. Most automobiles use two synchronized radial type arms, while many commercial vehicles use one or more pantograph arms.
The project is about the implementing of the car wiper control system. In this project by using STM32F407 IDE software , we have to use one switch button, resisters, power supply and 4 different LEDs,those four leds are red,green,blue and orange. In this we have to use ignition also so then only wiper will move.
A current limiting resistor connects four user LEDs to the PD12, PD13, PD14, and PD15 pins of PORTD on the Discovery board. Firstly when we press on the button and hold it for two seconds then the red ignition will be on at the acc,then after sometime we have to again press the button for the desired sec,the it should on ble led,then so on like green and orange. And at the last the ignition should be turned off.
The advantage is that  it is quite easy for use it,less energy is consumed. But sometimes when water falls squarely on the rain sensor, the mechanism activates.


**STM32F407VG**

It is a high-performance ARM cortex-M4 thirty-two bit controller it is based on RISC architecture and works at one sixty eight megahertz frequency. The Cortex-M4 core of this module provides unique and accurate FPU or floating-point units that incorporates with all types of ARM data commands.
The STM32F407 belongs to the family of microcontrollers and has a core of ARM cortex-M4 which is based on the RISC (Reduced-instruction-set Computing) structure.
This module comprises of large operating speed embedded memory units such as flash memory having a storage capacity of one megabyte, static random access memory of one ninety kilobytes, with that has four-kilo bytes Static ram as back up memory unit.
It printing and scanning machines this device is used. Heat ventilation AC system, security systems, also used this device. In different types of devices used in homes comprises of this module.

  *Features of STM32F407
It comprises of thirty two-bit central processing unit having a core of Cortex M4.
